Welcome to my Portfolio! This webpage showcases a collection of my data analytics/science projects, demonstrating my expertise and passion for extracting valuable insights from data. As a data enthusiast, I have explored various datasets, applied advanced analytical techniques, and developed machine-learning models to solve real-world problems.

### 1.- USING MACHINE LEARNING TO IMPROVE TREATMENT TARGETING IN FARMER TRAINING

**California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Winter Quarter 2023 + Spring Quarter 2023**

**Project Description**
> Cal Poly's Masters of Science in Quantitative Economics program project collaboration with the World Bank IFC branch. A 6-month long project where my team and I worked on analyzing farming techniques in developing countries and developed multiple machine learning models (Ridge, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Network). Using datasets from two developing countries we compared our machine learning models to improve treatment targeting in farmer training and see the lasting effects of new training techniques. Training machine learning models, data validation, data analysis, writing a research paper, and presenting results were some of the tasks we did.

**Personal Challenges**
> This is the most challenging and rewarding project I've ever worked on. I was new to machine learning at this time, so I was a bit worried at first, but thanks to my teammates, the World Bank team, and my ability to adapt and learn things quickly, I was able to involve myself in the project and contribute a lot. I used different software to clean the data and develop machine-learning models. For this project, patience and diligence proved essential as we often found ourselves returning to the beginning to re-clean the data. This was prompted by discovering new variables that could enhance our analysis or eliminate outdated ones. It took a lot of time to complete this project, but the feeling of overcoming all the challenges and the fact that our results can be used to help farmers in developing countries is priceless.

**Technical Skills**
> Python, R Studio, Stata, Markdown, Git, GitHub, Excel, Microsoft Office

### 2.- COMPARING HOUSING PRICES IN SAN DIEGO AND SACRAMENTO COUNTIES

**California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Spring Quarter 2023**

**Project Descriptive**

> Group project that consisted of gathering housing price data in two different California counties (San Diego and Sacramento), running various time series tests on the data, and comparing results. We then visualized the data and tests to present it to the class and provide them in our project report. We used FRED data.

**Personal Challenges**

> Although I participated in every aspect of the project, my main role was data gathering, data cleaning, and analysis. This was my first "real test" doing data validation. I had to gather and prepare the data to run time series tests on it. Without much guidance, I worked together with my teammates to streamline the process of sharing my code for replication and visualizations for presentation. Working with a group, I understood that communication is key, breaking tasks into parts is an efficient way to get the work done, and it is rewarding to have a group you can trust.

### 3.- THE ECONOMICS OF POPULATION GROWTH AND IMMIGRATION ON UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN CALIFORNIA

**California State University, Sacramento. Spring semester 2022**

**Project Description** 

> This individual project consisted of picking a topic of my interest for which we needed to research previous literature, look for and gather enough data to run tests (OLS regression, statistical tests), analyze it, write a report, and present it to the Sacramento State economics faculty.

**Personal Challenges**

> This was the very first big project I had to do individually. To my surprise, it was not easy to find a reputable data source with enough observation to make my results statistically significant, so I had to make a few compromises. Once I obtained data with enough observations, I had to clean the data set and get rid of outliers, as this would throw off my regression results and tests. Lastly, I ran a basic OLS regression, performed a few statistical tests on the data, and wrote a 20-page report on my results. This was also my first time presenting a complex project to a big audience, so I had to practice and get used to explaining my results to classmates and economics faculty.
